                    <p> We would get them on our
                        platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.</p>

                    Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the fort. 
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                    investment as is with other crypto currency project.
